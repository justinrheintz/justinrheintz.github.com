Updates as of 12th January, 2012

I'll try to keep the most up-to-date development information in the issues section of our GitHub Repo. <http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap/issues>
Most of the work I've done is to get theme support up and running. Look forward to theme releases from collaborators =).

- rss support
- commenting with disqus
- code highlighting with pygment
- modular theming **\[check\]**
- easier content creation via rakefile scripts
- Overlaying Functionality with javascript.
- managing static assets.
- using the paginator.
- inspect plugin (way to inspect data objects mainly)
- sitemap generation **\[check\]**
